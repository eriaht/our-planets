# Solar System Model with HTML and CSS Using SVG Paths
Orbit the sun with HTML and CSS. The model is kind of accurateâ€”not really; however, it was fun to make. I learned how SVG offset paths work in the process of making this. Don't bother waiting around to watch Neptune complete a single orbit; that will take approximately 27 minutes.

### How I got the revolution times in seconds
10s for every 365.26 days

| Planet | Revolution period
| --- | ---|
| Mercury | 87.97 days
| Venus   | 224.7 days
| Earth   | 365.26 days
| Mars    | 1.88 years
| Jupiter | 11.86 years
| Saturn  | 29.46 years
| Uranus  | 84.01 years
| Neptune | 164.79 years
