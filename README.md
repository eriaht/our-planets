# Solar System Model with HTML and CSS Using SVG Paths
Orbit the Sun with HTML and CSS. The model is kind of accurateâ€”not really; however, it was fun to make. I learned how SVG offset paths work in the process of making this. Don't bother waiting around to watch Neptune complete a single orbit; that will take approximately 27 minutes.

### How I got the revolution times in seconds for css animation
10 seconds for every 365.26 days

| Planet | Revolution period | CSS Revolution time
| --- | --- | --- |
| Mercury | 87.97 days  | (87.97 / 365.26) * 10s
| Venus   | 224.7 days  | (224.7 / 365.26) * 10s
| Earth   | 365.26 days | (365.26 / 365.26) * 10s
| Mars    | 1.88 years  | 1.88 * 10s
| Jupiter | 11.86 years | 11.86 * 10s
| Saturn  | 29.46 years | 29.46 * 10s
| Uranus  | 84.01 years | 84.01 * 10s
| Neptune | 164.79 years | 164.79 * 10s
