# Solar System Model with HTML and CSS Using SVG Paths
Here, our planets are orbiting the sun, made with HTML and CSS. It's kind of accurateâ€”not really; however, it was fun to make. I learned how SVG offset paths work in the process of making this. Don't bother waiting around to watch Neptune complete a single orbit; that will take approximately 27 minutes.
